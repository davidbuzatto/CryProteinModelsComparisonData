# 3-Domain Cry Protein Models Comparison Data

This file package contains all the data concerning the comparison among 3-Domain Cry Protein Models, specified in the table below, which were generated using the [Dali Method][daliURL] and processing the best result of the algorithm output.

The package is organized as follows:

* Two kinds of folders:
  * **Protein1**XXX(**ModelId1**)\_x\_**Protein2**\_(**ModelId2**);
  * Receptors\_**Protein**.

The folders that are named using the pattern **Protein1**\_(**ModelId1**)\_x\_**Protein2**\_(**ModelId2**), for example Cry1Aa1\_(1CIY)\_x\_Cry1Ac1\_(4ARX), contains data related to the comparison between the two protein models defined in its name. The folers that are name using the pattern Receptors\_**Protein**, for example Receptors\_Cry1Aa1, contains data related to the comparison between the protein defined in its name and all the other protein models (table above), focusing in the receptor regions pointed out in the literature related to the Cry protein activity. Each folder contains various kings of files, which are described below:

## **Protein1**\_(**ModelId1**)\_x\_**Protein2**\_(**ModelId2**)

* aligned\_mol1A\_**Protein1**\_(**ModelId1**).pdb: PDB file containing the Dali result for Protein1/Model1;
* aligned\_mol2A\_**Protein2**\_(**ModelId2**).pdb: PDB file containing the Dali result for Protein2/Model2;
* **Protein1**\_(**ModelId1**)\_x\_**Protein2**\_(**ModelId2**)-rawDali.txt: Dali output result for the best structural alignment between Protein1/Model1 and Protein2/Model2;
* **Protein1**\_(**ModelId1**)\_x\_**Protein2**\_(**ModelId2**)-procDali.txt: Dali output result for the best structural alignment between Protein1/Model1 and Protein2/Model2 processed to slice only the continuous regions without gaps;
* scriptSlice**N**.tcl: TCL (Tool Command Language) script used to open the slice **N** of the structural alignment in [VMD][VMDURL];
* scriptSlice**ReceptorRegion**\_**Protein1**\_**ProteinX**.tcl: TCL script used to open the **ReceptorRegion** slice of the structural alignment between **Protein1** and **ProteinX** in [VMD][VMDURL] (the batch file that uses this file is contained in the Receptors folders);
* visualizeSlice**N**.bat: Windows batch file used to invoke [VMD][VMDURL], passing the corresponding TCL file to open the slice **N** of the structural alignment.

## Receptors\_**Protein**

* **ProteinReceptorRegion**.png: PNG image file containing the detailed image of all **ReceptorRegions** in **Protein** against the compared proteins;
* **ProteinReceptorRegion**\_**ProteinN**.png: PNG image file containing the detailed image of **ReceptorRegions** in **Protein** against the compared **ProteinN**;
* Receptors\_**ProteinReceptorRegion**-procDali.txt: Dali output result for the best structural alignment between **Protein** and the compared proteins at the **ReceptorRegion**;
* visualizeSlice**ReceptorRegion**\_**Protein**\_**ProteinN**.bat: Windows batch file used to invoke [VMD][VMDURL], passing the corresponding TCL file to open the slice of **ReceptorRegion** in the structural alignment between **Protein** and **ProteinN**.
